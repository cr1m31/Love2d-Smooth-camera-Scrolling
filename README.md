This was made for a tutorial.

Install:
download the folder
and load the main.lua file with some Lua interpreter (i use zerobrane).
Also install love2d.

It is basically a world with a player on it and a camera following the player smoothly.
The trick is to use interpolation between the camera and the player to achieve this effect.

Ps: you can zoom on the player with the mouse wheel.
